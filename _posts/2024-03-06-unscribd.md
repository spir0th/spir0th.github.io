Weaknessing Scribd.com's unblockable 30-day trial popup for educational purposes

<!-- more -->

Have you ever get annoyed? When searching for the right document on [Scribd](https://www.scribd.com/),
you read through multiple pages, and suddenly a popup just *pops up* on your
view, then says "You need to pay us dollars to view more"?

Of course you do! Imagine as a student, you don't have enough money to pay their stuff just for research purposes, or if you're rich enough to buy a lambo, you wouldn't even need it after you're done researching. What a waste of money...

In this blog, I'll be showing you how to get rid of the popup using the
browser's developer tools!

## The hacky solution
Well, first things first, you need to reload the page using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> or <kbd>F5</kbd> on your browser.

Then, open DevTools by right-clicking the page then select **Inspect**:
![Demonstrate Inspect option](/assets/img/unscribd/inspect.png)

Once DevTools is opened, go into the Console tab, then paste this code:
```javascript
(function() {
    "use strict"; setInterval(function() {
        var elements = document.getElementsByClassName("auto__doc_page_webpack_doc_page_blur_promo");
        var promos = document.getElementsByClassName("promo");
        var popups = document.getElementsByClassName("_140Ouo _3DzOla");
        var as = document.getElementsByClassName("a");
        var ls = document.getElementsByClassName("l");
        var absImgs = document.getElementsByClassName("absimg");
        var layers = document.getElementsByClassName("text_layer");

	    while (elements.length > 0) {
		    elements[0].parentNode.removeChild(elements[0]);
	    }
	    while (promos.length > 0) {
		    promos[0].parentNode.removeChild(promos[0]);
	    }
        for (var i = 0; i < popups.length; i++) {
            popups[i].remove();
        }
	    for (i = 0; i < as.length; i++) {
		    as[i].style.color = "black";
	    }
	    for (i = 0; i < ls.length; i++) {
		    ls[i].style.color = "black";
	    }
	    for (i = 0; i < absImgs.length; i++) {
		    absImgs[i].style.opacity = 1;
	    }
	    for (let item of layers) {
	        item.style.textShadow = "";
	    }
	}, 1000);
})();
```

## Result

*A screenshot of an unblurred document, Scribd.com*

Voila! You have successfully unblurred the pages of a Scribd document!
It may be a hacky and tedious solution, but it works as expected.
If you do have problems at unblurring though, it's up for the internet
to come up for another solution.
