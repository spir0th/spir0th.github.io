Seriously, what could go wrong with the [COVID-19 outbreak?](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019)

<!-- more -->

The COVID-19 outbreak was probably the worst experience I've ever suffered, from being so confident to go outside, to being depressed and very shy to make friends (screw u covid).

Anyways, I'm going to divide each bad events into chapters that led me into depression and loneliness! (aaugghhh this is gonna be pain)

## Quarantined & Locked down
After the start of year 2020, many countries were locked down and had been implementing community quarantines to prevent the outbreak of COVID-19 disease.

Now, this didn't make sense to me. Because I just like to play games at that time and don't wanna get involved with some huge argument about the quarantines online.

And because of the outbreak, the government tried to shut down some establishments in various regions, internet cafes have been closed down, and even basketball courts also being closed in order to comply with the COVID-19 precautions and guidelines.

I was also quite happy that there might not a school year starting up to this point. Until [DepED](https://deped.gov.ph) then a few days later, announced that classes for school year 2020-2021 continues. (rip)

## The Downsides
It was mid-2020, and it was at near the start of school year 2020-2021.

I almost felt like I didn't wanna go to school at this point, because I was so trapped inside our house that I could only think of playing games and coding.

After this, a serious madness of ramble happened as the [Road and Traffic Administration](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100068600627542) tries to block the main road leading to the city.

Then the next few months, my school grades gradually decreased because of my motivation to do school work is no longer there for me. (wow such a big L)

## Bonus: Infatuated
**You can skip this story if you would like to.**

I usually don't tell stories about my crushes,
but this event was so important for me to remember because it actually increased my self-confidence for a bit during the outbreak.

During Summer 2021, I met my step-cousin? or my cousin's stepsister? idk???, but she looked pretty and quiet (i sound like an idiot while writing this).

After a few family bondings, I noticed that she speaks in English and barely uses our native language (Bisaya) and I find it really rare. Because most of the girls I've met and talked so far in my life always use our native language and are having difficult to speak in English.

Then after a few months, she stopped joining in our family bondings, because idk maybe she's busy or something? Anyway, my cousin then told me that she recently had a relationship with someone. (sad)

As of writing this, my infatuation for her still didn't stop, and because of her, my interest of pretty girls somewhat increased.
(don't call me a weirdo just because I like pretty girls)

## End of The Outbreak
It's the year 2022, and things have started to calm.

More and more countries have been stopped the lockdown and quarantines, the requirement of face masks and face shields are no longer required. That means the government isn't no longer strict than it was before!

And here I am, ready for senior high school, and still alive! (definitely not a Portal reference)

So, what has changed to me? To be honest, these days I have been quite fine. But not so normal like back in the days, I used to be so talkative before the outbreak and now I'm completely shy to meet strangers and make friends.

Probably in the future, I wanted that kind of extrovert personality to return, hehe.

Soo, that's it. It's not very sad for how I've been feeling but rather the bad ways I've carried along this experience. Anyways, bye!
